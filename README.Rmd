## Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Assignment

The assignment required to implement the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

After doing the steps above, CodeBook.Rmd details the variables and other relevant information. The code is implemented in a file called run_analysis.R and the final tidy data set is in a file called secondSet.txt.
